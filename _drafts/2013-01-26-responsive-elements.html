<p>Responsive sites need responsive elements.</p>
<p>1) Images - though if they are small images, this may not be necessary.</p>
<p>2) Tables - Can use responsive table methods depending on type of table</p>
<p>3) Navigation - an accordion menu may be useful for this. Combine top and left nav elements and show top items. Could use a toggle menu or slide in menu.</p>
