<p>There are webapps which are like webpages and run in webkit. You can run a webapp offline.</p><!--more--> 
<p>Then there are native apps which you get through the appstore. They have access to more native features of the device.</p>
<p>You can use phonegap to compile html, css, and javascript to a native app but this requires xcode.</p>
<p>Xcode requires a developer license or osx lion to download.</p>
<p>Dreamweaver 5.5 Â works with phonegap but maybe not with ios5.</p>
<p>Most apps appear to be native apps which are compiled webapps.</p>
