<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>Java is used to write apps for it. It appears to be open source but Google is heavily involved with it's development. "Ice cream sandwich" is the next release apparently coming out later this year. Android uses webkit for its browser and chrome's javascript engine. I read it supports html5.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Apple's mobile os. iOS5 is to be released later this year. Safari is it's web browser. Used on the iPad as well.</p>
