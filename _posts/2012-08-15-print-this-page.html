<p>The print this page link is not really necessary in my opinion as the user can use the browser to print a page.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Kind of like the resize text functionality.</p>
<p>If used, it is probably a good idea to use a print icon as a background image and then use link text. It would use javascript and so can be added in with javascript.</p>
<p>CUE guidelines state tools are optional and should precede and be after the content.</p>
<p>Tools include print, email, share, subscribe and rate this page.</p>
