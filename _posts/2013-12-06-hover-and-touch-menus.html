<p>Hover menus can trigger events on safari on iPad and iPhone. If you add touch events there seems to be some problems. It's not really a good idea to have one or the other as both options may be available in the future. The only way around it is to not use css hover, just javascript for the hover effects or to use a menu that Safari doesn't trigger events on safari.</p>
