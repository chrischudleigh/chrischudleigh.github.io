<p>The local copy of wordpress stopped working for me. When I got a fibre connection with a new isp, I got a new ip and so wordpress was looking for the old ip address I had.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Change the mysql database entry in wordpress for the url.</p>
<p>While investigating, I decided it is better to create a virtual host eg. blog.local This is added in two places:</p>
<p>See<a href=" http://sawmac.com/mamp/virtual/ "> http://sawmac.com/mamp/virtual/ </a> for details.</p>
<p>If you place the website in your sites directory, wordpress also needs you to give the directory admin access it seems.</p>
<p>To duplicate the remote site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export and import the content</li>
<li>Redo the widgets and the menus.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
