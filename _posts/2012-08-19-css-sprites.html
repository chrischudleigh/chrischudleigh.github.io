<p>Css sprites are used to combine background images used on a website into one image.</p><!--more--> 
<p>The background-position property is then set to select a particular image.</p>
<p>This is meant to reduce the number of requests to the server.</p>
<p>Background-position uses pixels tho - so I am unsure whether it is a good idea to use as when text is resized the icon may appear offset.</p>
