<p>Forms should use fieldset to group related items such as radio buttons and checkboxes and associated fields such as address.</p>
<p>Legend tag should be first item in fieldset to describe the group.</p>
<p>Labels should be used. You can use a title attribute for a search field instead of a label. There are a few places where a title attribute should be used instead of label tags - see wcag examples.</p>
