<p>Alt text appears when images are turned off and is read by screenreaders.</p><!--more--> 
<p>It displays incorrectly as a tooltip in IE6 and IE7 only. </p>
<p>If an image is the only item in a link alt text should be specified. If there is an image and text in a link the image can have "" alt text. </p>
<p>Note if you place anchor tags around an image and an adjacent link and give the image the same alt text as the link text, screenreaders will stutter so this is not the best idea.</p>
<p>Title text displays a tooltip but is dependent on a pointing device. It is not reliable as it does not show in some mobile devices etc. </p>
