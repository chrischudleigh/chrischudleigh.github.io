<p>Formats:</p>
<p>ibook - apple<br />
ePub - open<br />
folio - adobe</p>
<p>The ibook app requires ios ie. you cannot read iBooks on your mac.</p>
<p><!--more-->The ibook author runs on osx but requires a fairly new mac.</p>
<p>ePub is open source and standards but epub3 supports more complex layouts but there are no real readers for it.</p>
<p>Indesign can export to ePub but it is not semantic.</p>
<p>Indesign can create folio files but expensive to distribute. Alot of work to make flexible layouts in Indesign.</p>
<p>Why not just make a book in html, css, and javascript like webpages and then group them with ajax?</p>
